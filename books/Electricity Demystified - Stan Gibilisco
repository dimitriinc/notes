I. A CIRCUIT DIAGRAM SAMPLER

Block Diagrams - the simpliest of diagrams: components are rectangles, wires and cables - straight lines, connected wires have points in the connection
	   	 places. there also can be switches, voltmeters, earth ground, etc. Multiple-wire cables and a single-conductor wire are represented
	   	 the same. (e.g. there are 3-conductor cords, that in the book connect generator to appliances directly, the voltmeter connects its
	   	 single-conductor wire to the voltage-carrying wire in that cord, aka 'hot')
	   	 when two cables are crossed and connected, it's good practice to separate input and output and give each one a dot, so that the point
	   	 of connection is easy to spot.
	   	 another way to represent cables that are not connected is to add a little arch to one of them, a 'jog' or a 'jump'
	   	 to denote the direction of the electrical energy or power, you put arrows to the cable lines, e.g. from generator to appliences.
	   	 voltmeter doesn't need arrows, becuase a good one doesn't consume any power.
	   	 
Schematic Diagrams - has a plethora of special symbols for different kinds of possible components of a circuit, like capacitors, logic gates, grounds,
		     bataries, etc. those components can be grouped in categories, and those categories have common traits in their graphic 
		     representation: e.g. resistors will have a zig-zag in their symbols. the components can be connected in series or in parallel,
		     the behavior of the circuit changes depending on the method of connection: e.g. the resistor in series will reduce the voltage
		     and dim the bulb, in parallel the higher the resistence in the resistor the brighter is the bulb, because the resistor consumes
		     less of the electrical flow. the parallel connection is useful when you want the components to receive all the battery's voltage
		     at same value: e.g. you'd connect several bulbs in parallel and they will all shine equally bright.
		     that resistor that regulates the voltage coming through to the bulb, is called a potentiometer
		     
		     
		     
II. CHARGE, CURRENT, VOLTAGE, AND RESISTANCE

For electricity to exist, a source of electric charge should be present.

Charge - there are two types of charges: negative and positive (the names are just a convention). two electrically charged objects, when moved close
	 together, will attract or repel each other. the force of attraction or repulsion is called 'electrostatic force' (not the same as magnetic
	 force). the magnitude of the force depends on two factors:
	 
	 	> total extent of the charge (aka charge quantity) - the charges of both objects together. when it's increased, the electrostatic force
	 	  increases in direct proportion to the charge quantity, considering the second factor doesn't change
	 	> distance btn centers of the objects - when the distance is increased, the electrostatic force decreases according to the square of 
	 	  the distance, considering the charge quantity stays the same.
	 	  
	 * atom - nucleus: protons and neutrons - dense and packed together; electrons - orbit around the nucleus, but not so dense and it's common
	   	  for them to jump to another nucleus. protons and electrons of one atom are equally and opposedly charged. by convention, protons 
	   	  have positive charge, and electrons - negative. amount of charge on any proton is the same as the amount of charge on any other 
	   	  proton, the same goes for electrons, they all have the same amount of charge. neutrons don't carry any electrical charge.
	   	  
	 * electron - free-roaming electrons is what causes the 'electrostatic charge'. the objects that have an excess of electrons compared to their
	 	      protons are said to be negatively charged; when the object contains more protons than electrons, its positively charged.
	 	      
	 * units of charge - since every electron in the universe in normal circumstances has equal amount of electrostatic charge, this is taken as
	 		     a unit of measure, and is called 'elementary charge unit' (ECU). though it's very small, so for real-life objects we 
	 		     measure the charge in 'coulombs' (C) which is equal to 6,24 x 10^18 ECU.
	 		     
Current - when charged particles move, it results in electric current. usually those particles are electrons, jumping fron one nucleus to another. some
	  materials have atomic structure well fit for providing a good environment for the free exchange of electrons, such materials are called 
	  conductors. best conductor is silver, copper and aluminum are good conductors, most metals are fair to good, salt water is fair, distilled
	  water is a pooor conductor. substances that do not create a good environment for the exchange of electrons are called 'insulators': most 
	  gases are insulators, glass, dry wood, paper, plastic, pure water (though some minerals diluted in it may cause it to conduct electricity),
	  some metalic oxides. an insulating material is often called a 'dielectric', since it keeps electric charges apart. when there are two regions
	  of opposite polarity, separated by a dielectric, this pair of regions is called 'electric dipole'.
	  
	- current is measured in terms of the number of charge carriers that pass a certain point in the span of 1 second. again, to measure it in ECU
	  per second would mean to operate on gigantic numbers, so the standard measure is one coulomb per second, a current of 1 C/s is called 
	  'ampere' (A).
	  
	- in physics, they think about the current flowing in the circuit from positive terminal to negative terminal, this is so-called 'theoretical
	  current'. but actual electrons, which carry the charge, flow from negative to positive. remains to be understood.
	  
Voltage - current will flow only if the charge carriers are 'pushed' or 'motivated', this motivation is provided by a build of electrostatic charges.
	  when negative charge builds up in one place, and a positive one in another, electromotive force (EMF) exists. EMF, aka 'voltage', or 
	  'electrical potential' is expressed in 'volts'
	  
	- some common voltages: household electricity - 110-130V, it's not stable, the voltage changes polarity several times per second
		- an automotive battery - 12V, steady, constant voltage
		- by walking on a carpet with rubber soles - thousands of V (not deadly, becuase not a lot of charge carries acumulate to provide for
		  a deadly current
		- before a lightning discharges - millions of V btn clouds, or btn a cloud and the ground
		
	- voltage can exits w/o current, that is the case right before the lightning, in a house outlet btn the terminals when nothing is connected,
	  battery with nothing connected. this is called 'static electricity'. it stops being static when a good pathway btn terminals presents itself
	  
	- in case of a steady voltage not changing its polarity, the current that flows through an electrical device is directly proportional to the
	  voltage supplied to the divice: if the voltage doubles, the current doubles as well. though it's common that devices vary their 'conductance'
	  depending on the current. some devices are designed to have a constant conductance event if voltage (and current with it) vary greatly.
	  
Resistance - opposite of conductance. no material is perfectly conductive, there is always some resistance. conductors have low resistance, insulators
    	     high. where resistance is high, it's difficult for current to flow.
    	     
    	   - measured in 'ohms' (represented by the Greek letter omega - Ω). in an electrical system as low as possible resistance is desired, because 
    	     resistance (aka ohmic value) converts electrical energy into heat, and it's considered a waste ('resistance loss'). given a constant
    	     voltage, the current varies in inverse proportion to the resistance, i.e. if resistance doubles, the current is cut in half; if 
    	     resistance is a fith of its previous value, current increases by the factor of 5.
    	     when current flows through a resistive material, it gives rise to voltage across the resistive object (this kind of voltage is called 
    	     'potential difference'; the larger the current, the greater is the voltage (directly proportional given the resistance is the same)
    	     
    	   - conductors can loose all their resistance at temperatures near the absolute zero, this phenomenon is called 'super-conductivity'.
    	     so the conditions may affect the resistance of a certain component in a practical circuit. this fluctuations in high/low resistance can
    	     be made to happen billions times per second.
    	     
    	     
III. OHM'S LAW, POWER, AND ENERGY

	> prefix multipliers - denote small fractions or big numbers, starting with small:
		- pico - p - one trillionth part - 0.000 000 000 001
		- nano - n - one billionth - 0.000 000 001
		- micro - μ/mm - one millionth - 0.000 001
		- milli - m - one thousandth - 0.001
		- kilo - k/K - 1000
		- mega - M - million - 1 000 000
		- giga - G - billion - 1 000 000 000
		- tera - T - trillion - 1 000 000 000 000
		
	> Ohm's law - in a DC curcuit current flows through a medium with a resistence, it's pushed through a resistive material by voltage. Current,
		      voltage, and resistance interact in a predictable and precise way. The Ohm's law describes this way in mathematical terms.
		      the law is denoted in three formulas:
		      
		      		E = IR		
		      		I = E/R		
		      		R = E/I		
		      		
		      where E - voltage in volts, I - current in amperes, R - resistance in ohms
		      the formulas function only with those units of measure
		      
	> Power - is the rate at which energy consumed or used, i.e. energy per unit of time. The unit of power is 'watt' (W), in equations - italic P.
		  one W is one J (joule, energy) per second
		  a conventional household bulb uses 25 W to 100 W. We can calculate power when we know 2 of the 3 basic measures of the curcuit with
		  one of these formulas:
		  
		  		P = EI
		  		P = E^2/R
		  		P = I^2*R
		  		
	> Energy - ability to do work or cause a change. consists of power expended (used) over a period of time. the unit of energy is 'joule' (J), it
		   also can be represented as watt-second (Ws), i.e. 1 J of energy is 1 W of power expended over 1 sec.
		   in practice, a joule is too small of a unit to measure energy, the Wh (watt-hour) is more usefull, i.e. 1 watt of power consumed for
		   one hour (3600 seconds) => 1 Wh = 3600 Ws = 3600 J.
		   in medium-sized electrical systems (e.g. households) even Wh is too small to measure the energy, more practical is kWh (kilowatt-
		   hour), or 3600 * 1000 = 3,600,000 J
		   in large electrical networks (e.g. utility grids in cities) we use MWh (megawatt-hour), 3600 * 1,000,000 J.
		   
		   energy formulas:
		   W - energy (Wh, whatt-hour)
		   E - voltage (V, volts)
		   I - current (A, amper)
		   R - resistance (Ω, ohm)
		   t - time (h, hour)
		   
		   	W = EIt
		   	W = (E^2)t/R
		   	W = (I^2)Rt
		   	
		   power and energy reference each other in their definitions: power is energy per unit time, energy is power multiplied by time.
		   in termes of movement, power is like speed, and energy is like the distance covered.
		   power consumed falls and rises at different moments of time, energy consumed increases over time relentlessly.
