PART I. THE DIMENSIONS OF READING
-------------------------------------------------




1. THE ACTIVITY AND ART OF READING




Active reading: there is a book, and there is your mind - the two participants in the process. Supposedly, the book has something to teach you, and your job is to elevate your mind to the level of the book. Active reading is when a qualitative change happens in the mind of the reader.

Modes of reading:

	- reading for entertainment - requires almost no effort, close to no knowledge, and absolutely no understandment earned.
	- reading for knowledge - acquiring facts, sometimes memorization, e.g. reading news, magazines, etc. the author and the reader are almost on the same level of understanding, the reader might grow laterally, broadening the number of facts he knows, but the quality of his understanding doesn't grow. the material doesn't challenge the reader.
	- reading for understanding - the author posseses higher understandment than the reader, hence the reader doesn't understand the material fully, is challenged to go into the unknown territory to better his mind. requires the most effort. implies not only the knowledge of whats (facts), but whys and hows, and how it is all connected to other things. bridging the gap for the reader towards the author is inherently an active process that requires an intellect trained in analysis and reflection, keen observation, range of imagination. Here we go from the condition of understanding less to understanding more.
	
The book is concerned with the reading for understanding. When we master that the knowledge part takes care of itself.
	
Modes of learning:
	
	> learning by instruction - with a teacher in form of a person (oral instruction) or a text (written instruction), a guided learning.
	> learning by discovery - the learner is on his own, against the nature. his tools are observation, research, reflection.
	
Both types of learning are active processes that involve thinking as the use of our minds to gain knowledge and understanding.

With learning by written instruction, i.e. by reading, when we encounter the gap between us and the author, i.e. something we don't understand, and ask questions about it, we are the ones who must answer the questions. In that aspect, reading is like learning by unaided discovery: we must rely on our research and reflection; and we can do it only if we know how - and that's the goal of this book.




2. THE LEVELS OF READING



Levels are different from types in that each new level is not separate from the previous one, but incorporates it; new levels build on top of each other; the higher levels includes all the levels.

Levels of reading:

	- Elementary reading - concerned with the question: 'what does the sentence say?' on the surface level; requires understanding of words and what they mean.
	- Inspectional reading - concerned with the understanding of the meta information about the book within a short period of time, i.e. the book's field, genre, structure, etc. The time restriction can be 15 min.
	- Analytical reading - concerned with the best possible understanding within an unlimited period of time. Intensely active reading, asking questions, etc.
	- Syntopical reading - reflection upon the data from the book in the broader context of other books on similar or adjacent topics. Comparing, synthesizing new ideas and understanding from the context that might not be present in any of the books in that context.
	
	
	

3. ELEMENTARY READING


Basic recodgnition of letters, sounds, words, sentences. Happens in early schooling. He describes 4 different stages of elementary reading:

	- recognizing letters, groups of letters
	- start to get meaning behind words and sentences
	- growth of vocabulary, deriving meaning from context
	- recognizing common ideas across different texts
	




4. INSPECTIONAL READING



There are two steps to that as well:

	- skimming trough book's metadata, i.e. title, subtitle, table of contents, index, publisher notes, and closing statements (maybe few last pages, where author might summarize the key points of the book). the goal is to get the first impression and pigeonhole the book according to its category of some sort, and also have the first impression of its structure.
	- superficial reading - reading the actual text but without lingering on the parts we don't understand, just skipping them through.
	
With the Inspectional reading we get the most of the book we can in a limited time. Both steps should be undertaken with time in mind, as fast as possible.





5. HOW TO BE A DEMANDING READER


Comes back to the idea of active reading. It's the reading with a firmly identified goal of improving one's mind by internalizing the book at hand. 
The understanding comes through active interaction with the text. This interaction comes in form of asking the four core questions, and trying to answer them:

	- What this book is about? the central theme.
	- What is being said in detail? the main ideas, arguments, etc. and how are they structured.
	- How true is the author's assertions? critical inspection of the ideas.
	- What of it? the significance of the book, how does it fit in your existent tree of understanding.

The main technique of engaging with the book (making it ours) is note taking. Among other methods of notetaking, we can write down on margins the questions and possible answers, that the passage provokes in us; we can ennumerate the sequence of related arguments; we can leave pointers to other pages, where related ideas are; we can use the endpapers in the back for indexing the ideas in the text, and front papers to write a summary of the whole book.

Three kinds of note-taking:

	- Structural: take them during inspectional reading, what kind of book it is, what is about in general, what is the structure?
	- Conceptual: during analytical reading: about the truth and significance of the ideas in the book (questions 3 and 4).
	- Dialectical: about the shape of the discussion the book is involved with other books on similar subject.
	
Active reading is a skill, aquired by habitual practice, internalizing the techniques, so you don't have to think about doing them. Only unlike a physical skill, where you have to think about the movements at first (when you start to master the skill), you have to think about the thinking itself: what happens in your mind while you are engaged with a book? and to steer the mental activity in the right direction. It is harder than being aware of your body, but it can be done; and must be done, if you really want to aquire intellectual skills.

PART II. THE THIRD LEVEL OF READING: ANALYTICAL READING
------------------------------------------------------------------





6. PIGEONHOLING A BOOK



The first rule of analytical reading is "classify the book before reading it". With the data coming from the first stage of the inspectional reading (title, table of contents, etc.) we start building the mental image of the book. 
The simpliest form of classification is fiction vs. expository (science books and such).
Other distinction is between theoretical books and practical ones.
