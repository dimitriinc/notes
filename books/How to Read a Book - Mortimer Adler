PART I. THE DIMENSIONS OF READING
-------------------------------------------------




1. THE ACTIVITY AND ART OF READING




Active reading: there is a book, and there is your mind - the two participants in the process. Supposedly, the book has something to teach you, and your job is to elevate your mind to the level of the book. Active reading is when a qualitative change happens in the mind of the reader.

Modes of reading:

	- reading for entertainment - requires almost no effort, close to no knowledge, and absolutely no understandment earned.
	- reading for knowledge - acquiring facts, sometimes memorization, e.g. reading news, magazines, etc. the author and the reader are almost on the same level of understanding, the reader might grow laterally, broadening the number of facts he knows, but the quality of his understanding doesn't grow. the material doesn't challenge the reader.
	- reading for understanding - the author posseses higher understandment than the reader, hence the reader doesn't understand the material fully, is challenged to go into the unknown territory to better his mind. requires the most effort. implies not only the knowledge of whats (facts), but whys and hows, and how it is all connected to other things. bridging the gap for the reader towards the author is inherently an active process that requires an intellect trained in analysis and reflection, keen observation, range of imagination. Here we go from the condition of understanding less to understanding more.
	
The book is concerned with the reading for understanding. When we master that the knowledge part takes care of itself.
	
Modes of learning:
	
	> learning by instruction - with a teacher in form of a person (oral instruction) or a text (written instruction), a guided learning.
	> learning by discovery - the learner is on his own, against the nature. his tools are observation, research, reflection.
	
Both types of learning are active processes that involve thinking as the use of our minds to gain knowledge and understanding.

With learning by written instruction, i.e. by reading, when we encounter the gap between us and the author, i.e. something we don't understand, and ask questions about it, we are the ones who must answer the questions. In that aspect, reading is like learning by unaided discovery: we must rely on our research and reflection; and we can do it only if we know how - and that's the goal of this book.




2. THE LEVELS OF READING



Levels are different from types in that each new level is not separate from the previous one, but incorporates it; new levels build on top of each other; the higher levels includes all the levels.

Levels of reading:

	- Elementary reading - concerned with the question: 'what does the sentence say?' on the surface level; requires understanding of words and what they mean.
	- Inspectional reading - concerned with the understanding of the meta information about the book within a short period of time, i.e. the book's field, genre, structure, etc. The time restriction can be 15 min.
	- Analytical reading - concerned with the best possible understanding within an unlimited period of time. Intensely active reading, asking questions, etc.
	- Syntopical reading - reflection upon the data from the book in the broader context of other books on similar or adjacent topics. Comparing, synthesizing new ideas and understanding from the context that might not be present in any of the books in that context.
	
	
	

3. ELEMENTARY READING


Basic recodgnition of letters, sounds, words, sentences. Happens in early schooling. He describes 4 different stages of elementary reading:

	- recognizing letters, groups of letters
	- start to get meaning behind words and sentences
	- growth of vocabulary, deriving meaning from context
	- recognizing common ideas across different texts
	




4. INSPECTIONAL READING



There are two steps to that as well:

	- skimming trough book's metadata, i.e. title, subtitle, table of contents, index, publisher notes, and closing statements (maybe few last pages, where author might summarize the key points of the book). the goal is to get the first impression and pigeonhole the book according to its category of some sort, and also have the first impression of its structure.
	- superficial reading - reading the actual text but without lingering on the parts we don't understand, just skipping them through.
	
With the Inspectional reading we get the most of the book we can in a limited time. Both steps should be undertaken with time in mind, as fast as possible.





5. HOW TO BE A DEMANDING READER


Comes back to the idea of active reading. It's the reading with a firmly identified goal of improving one's mind by internalizing the book at hand. 
The understanding comes through active interaction with the text. This interaction comes in form of asking the four core questions, and trying to answer them:

	- What this book is about? the central theme.
	- What is being said in detail? the main ideas, arguments, etc. and how are they structured.
	- How true is the author's assertions? critical inspection of the ideas.
	- What of it? the significance of the book, how does it fit in your existent tree of understanding.

The main technique of engaging with the book (making it ours) is note taking. Among other methods of notetaking, we can write down on margins the questions and possible answers, that the passage provokes in us; we can ennumerate the sequence of related arguments; we can leave pointers to other pages, where related ideas are; we can use the endpapers in the back for indexing the ideas in the text, and front papers to write a summary of the whole book.

Three kinds of note-taking:

	- Structural: take them during inspectional reading, what kind of book it is, what is about in general, what is the structure?
	- Conceptual: during analytical reading: about the truth and significance of the ideas in the book (questions 3 and 4).
	- Dialectical: about the shape of the discussion the book is involved with other books on similar subject.
	
Active reading is a skill, aquired by habitual practice, internalizing the techniques, so you don't have to think about doing them. Only unlike a physical skill, where you have to think about the movements at first (when you start to master the skill), you have to think about the thinking itself: what happens in your mind while you are engaged with a book? and to steer the mental activity in the right direction. It is harder than being aware of your body, but it can be done; and must be done, if you really want to aquire intellectual skills.







------------------------------------------------------------------
PART II. THE THIRD LEVEL OF READING: ANALYTICAL READING
------------------------------------------------------------------





6. PIGEONHOLING A BOOK



The first rule of analytical reading is "classify the book before reading it". With the data coming from the first stage of the inspectional reading (title, table of contents, etc.) we start building the mental image of the book. 
The simpliest form of classification is fiction vs. expository (science books and such).
Other distinction is between theoretical books and practical ones.




7. X-RAYING A BOOK

The second rule of analytical reading is "State the unity of the whole book succinctly". A good book has a unity to it, how the parts are coming together under a unified architecture and goal.

The third rule is "Define the major parts of the book, and show how they are organized into a whole". Those parts are the building blocks of the building, they create something more than the sum of them all by dwelling in a hierarchy, ordered against each other, and connected to each other. Our goal here is to find the plan of this construction. The finer this structure is (i.e. how well the parts fit together to create the whole), the more readable the book is. 
In stating the parts, the table of contents should serve as a guide for our outline of the structure, not the structure itself: the subparts of a part can be dispersed through different chapters of the book.

The fourth rule is "Define the problem or set of problems the author tries to solve".

The first 4 rules comprise the first stage of analytical reading:

	- put the book into a category according to its kind and subject matter
	- describe the unity of the book in a brief sentence / paragraph
	- describe the complexity of the parts that construct the unity and their relations in the hierarchy
	- induce the intentions of the author
	
The stages of reading should not be perceived chronologically, and one stage can refine the other.





8. COMING TO TERMS WITH AN AUTHOR

The previous 4 rules were the outlining part of the analytical reading.
The first step of the second stage (interpretation of content) is understanding of the meaning of the author's terms. It's necessary for the transmission of knowledge, 'term' is the basic element of communicable knowledge.
We do it through finding the important words in the text and understand what the author means by them, this way we place ourselves on the same page with the author, and the communication can take place, when the reader and the author use the same words with the same meaning.
The important part is that this rule 5, as other rules of this second stage, involve two steps: linguistic (pinpointing important words), and semantic, i.e. interpretation of the meaning behind the linguistic tools. It's important because the nature of language is such that it cannot convey thoughts perfectly, the interpretation part is innate to understanding. 
'Word' is about linguistics, 'term' is about semantics. One word can be interpreted differently, thus, a word contains potential for several terms. And one term can be expressed with several words.

The importance of words is a spectrum, and the majority of words in a text are not important. The rule of thumb to distinguish important words is to look for the words that give you trouble to understand them, their meaning is not clear to you, because the author will use important words in some specific sense, and will use unimportant words by their ordinary meaning.

The sin of non-active reading is the reader's inattention to words.

As for finding the meaning of important words, this is where a lot of growing in understanding happens. In this process we must be aware that a single word can transmit a single term, and be used in this way consistently throughout the text (common with technical terms), or one world can be used by the author to convey multiple terms in different places - a good author will maintain consistency in this variable usage. Moreover, there are synonyms, i.e. one term can be conveyed by different words, thus there's a difference in the author's vocabulary and his terminology. Thirdly, a term can be expressed by a phrase.
And there's only one way to find out the meaning of a term - from its context, i.e. the words that surround it, and the meaning of which we understand.





9. DETERMINING AN AUTHOR'S MESSAGE

In the communication between the reader and the author, both not only have to come to terms for the communication to be successful, but they also have to establish what the author's propositions are. Those are generally speaking something the author has to offer to the readers, an idea he wants to instill, an opinion he wants to build up to the state of a fact; a promise of a progress he gives to a reader to take it somewhere up the road of understanding. 
To fulfill those propositions, so that they become more than his opinions, the author deploys arguments. Their purpose is to build the foundation of proved truths, on which the conclusive proposition can stand unbothered. An argument is a compound entity, it's a sequence of propositions, logically connected. Some propositions might be premises, some are conclusions, and a logical whole formed by those elements is an argument. 

So here we are at the stage of interpretation, we've established the 5th rule of analytical thinking (the 1st step in the interpretation stage), which is understand the terms; the 6th rule is to understand the authors propositios; and the 7th is to understand the author's arguments.

Terms belong to the realm of words mostly. Arguments and propositions are presented on the level of sentences and paragraphs (generally a paragraph denotes an argument). So, an attentive reader should pay attention not only to words, but be mindful of how the sentences are put together, and why the paragraphs are separated from each other in the exact way they are.

Sentences and paragraphs are linguistic elements, propositions and arguments are logical elements. Just like in the case of words and terms, we are dealing here with the problem of representing thoughts through the flawed medium of language. Thus, not every sentence constitues a proposition, and one sentence (a compound one) can contain multiple propositions.
Thus there's a parallel grammar running in a text, along with the grammar of the language. The way elements of thought relate to each other and build on top of each other is the grammar of semantics. 

"You cannot begin to deal with terms, propositions, and arguments - the elements of thought - until you can penetrate beneath the surface of lan­guage. So long as words, sentences, and paragraphs are opaque and unanalyzed, they are a barrier to, rather than a medium of, communication. You will read words but not receive knowl­edge."

To make it official, the SIXTH RULE OF READING is - "find the most important sentences and discover propositions they contain"; and the SEVENTH RULE OF READING is "locate or construct the basic arguments by finding them in the connection of sentences".

--- Finding the Key Sentences ---

Just like words, sentences are on a semantic grade: some are more reach in meaning than the others; and the reader's job is to discern the most important ones - they will contain the key propositions of the author. Othentimes, the author will denote the important ones by himself: explicitly (through styles and formats) and implicitly (by putting series of important sentences in a logical sequence to form an argument).
The general rule for a reader here is the same as with words: the sentences that give you difficulty in interpreting them, will likely be reach in information. We underline the importance of being perplexed and know it. To be productively wondered about what you read, you need to be awake while reading, and pay attention to the varying level of understanding for each sentance. 

"If you never ask yourself any questions about the meaning of a passage, you cannot expect the book to give you any insight you do not already possess."

An adjacent indicator thus is the speed at which you read: the sentences tense in meaning will make you to slow down, if you really read attentively.
To read attentively also means to recognize arguments. An awake mind will do it for you. It is designed to recognize logical sequences where one utterance grows from another, like an eye is designed to recognize colors. In the same way, a closed eye will not see colors, the mind which is asleep will miss the arguments.

--- Finding the Propositions ---

Is akin to understanding the meaning of the sentences. The basic principle is, again, similar to that of understanding terms, expressed with words, i.e. we derive the meaning from the context: we find the surrounding meanings we do understand, and build on top of them towards the idea that is not yet very intelligible to us. Only the context that we pull from in case of propositions is larger, it consists of multiple sentences. It also more complex, as the sentences can be complex, i.e. compounded to represent several propositions. To know how to swim in this complexity, we have to understand the grammar of composing a sentence, i.e. rules of syntax: e.g. how adverbs and participles adjust the meaning of a phrase, the function of a verb in a sentence, how different clauses can be related within one sentence, etc.
To find a proposition means to grasp the idea, the thought, the knowledge, that the author tried to convey with the use of the words he put into sentences. Words are a means to a goal and not the goal itself; there are a plethora of different ways to express the same idea by using the medium differently. So we focus on understanding the idea, and not the words.
A good test of understanding of the underlying idea is to express it with different words. If you can't escape from the words used by the author, it means that you have not digested the idea, you only swallowed the words.
Another good test is to search the pool of your experiences to find how the idea have manifested itself in them. We internalize something when we find how it connects to something else we have already internalized; and though some ideas from the book might be very specific to a niche where you don't have much experiences, on some level of abstraction there will be a relation that connects it to your lived experience, and if you truly grasped the idea, you will find that link. 

--- Finding the Arguments ---

Arguments, as logical units, don't have as exact mapping to the linguistic units as terms and propositions do. An argument, as a sequence of propositions where one grows from another, can be expressed with one compound sentence; it can be expressed with several sentences in one paragraph, it can coincide exactly with the paragraph, it can be spread out along multiple paragraphs. The logical connection of propositions to form a unity is what matters, not the graphical representation.
Authors, especially those of expositionary works, will help readers to identify arguments, sometimes by summarizing them at the end of a chapter of a book.
When spotting propositions we need to pay attention to the relations between them: a good argument will consist of clearly articulated propositions put in a chain, where one springs from another. A sign of a bad author, or of a propagantistic work, is an omition of some proposition in the chain of the argument.

There are some definite signs that we're dealing with an argument, and thus we can use them to find the arguments in the book:

- An argument consists of propositions, some of them will be premises designed to prove a final proposition, a conclusion. So when you notice a conclusion, look for premises; and when you notice premises (i.e. an author is trying to prove something), stay alert for a conclusion, and you will have the argument pinned down.

- Arguments can be categorized by the way they construct their proofs: they can prove a general statement by offering a collection of particular facts as evidence (inductive reasoning), or they can arrive to a conclusion by reasoning from other general truths (deduction). An argument can employ one or both types of reasoning to prove a point. When we realize that we are reading one of these manners to reason, we might assume we are inside of an argument.

- Any chain of propositions must start at some point, at the things the author and the reader agree to be true wihtout going deeper in the chain. Those kind of statements can be of two types: assumptions (can be anything as long as it's reasonable for the author and readers to agree upon) and self-evident propositions (common knowledge, implies some empirical truth, free from the author and the reader's opinions, e.g. "the whole is bigger than its parts"). Recognizing the establishment of the basic proposition, we can recognize the entrance to the argument.

--- Finding the Solutions ---

The final rule of analytical reading ties together its first stage (figuring out the book's structure) and the second stage (understanding the content). The last rule of the structural analysis was to state the problems the author tries to solve in the book. Now that we have acquianted ourselves with the author's terms, propositions, and arguments, we can look back at those problems, and ask ouselves the following questions: are the stated problems were solved in the course of the book? did the author raise other problems in the process? the problems that the author failed to solve, did he acknowledge himself the failure?
So, the EIGHT RULE OF READING is "find out what the author's solutions are".
