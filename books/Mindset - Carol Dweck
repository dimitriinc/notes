- fixed mindset denies you opportunities, makes you scared of challenges.
- fixed mind thrives in comfort zones, enjoys the well-known circumstances
- growth mindset enjoys when it gets hard, it thrives in stretching its abilities, venturing outside of a well-established domain
- fixed mind reacts to praise, growth - to correction
- this is hard, this is fun - first step to changing mindsets

- if you mind is fixed, a failure defines you, you tend to dwell on it, and be discouraged to keep on trying
  with a growth mindset, failures show you the palce where you're at at the moment of the failure, it's a feedback you your progress, and a motivation
  to try harder
  
- effortless performance comes from a maximum effort in preparation. a fixed mind sees he effortless performance and thinks that the performer is 
  a pure talent, they see one point in time, and don't see the trajectory over time. for a fixed mind working extra-hard means a lack of natural 
  ability, and if you don't have it, why try so hard?
  for a growth mind there is no bigger crime that have something that you value, and not put as much effort as you can into mastering it.
  
- don't praise the ability, praise the effort
- women are more succeptable to other people's opinons about them, they tend to take much more seriously than men.

- the belief that the traits of character are fixed is connected with judgment. as we keep track of everything that happens to us, and interpret this
  information based on our mindset, if our mindest is in the fixed mode we tend to jump to judgments very fast, about ourselves and about other 
  people as well. those kind of judgments are extreme and overly-dramatic interpretations of the occured events. in reality a failure doesn't mean
  stupidity or unworthiness, and success doesn't mean superiority. in reality it's just a part of the way.
  the cognitive therapy teaches to be aware when the judgments happen and take out the extremity from it.
